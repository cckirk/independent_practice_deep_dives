Answer the following questions as best you can:

1. What is a strength of Rails (or something you like about Rails)?

2. What is a "controller"? How is it different from a "route"?

3. Why could it be useful to render json over html?
It is useful because it allows for easy access to front end frameworks.

4. List at least one question you have about Rails.
I want to know whether there are other frameworks like rails for ruby or other programming languages.
